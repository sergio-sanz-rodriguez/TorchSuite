# TorchSuite 
TorchSuite is a versatile and feature-rich PyTorch-based library designed to simplify and accelerate deep learning development.  

It provides essential modules and utilities for training, inference, data handling, and model optimization, making it an invaluable tool for researchers, machine learning professionals, and practitioners.  

Currently, TorchSuite is fully optimized for **classification** tasks in computer vision. Future versions will extend support to object detection, segmentation, and other unstructured data types such as audio.  

## Modules  

- **Training and inference engine:** A robust `engine.py` module for seamless training and evaluation workflows.  
- **Flexible data loading:** `dataloaders.py` simplifies dataset preparation and augmentation.  
- **Utility functions:** `helper_functions.py` offers a collection of tools to enhance productivity.  
- **Learning rate scheduling:** `schedulers.py` provides adaptive learning rate strategies.  
- **Vision Transformer (ViT) support:** `vision_transformer.py` enables ViT implementations with PyTorch.  
- **Custom loss functions:** `loss_functions.py` includes various loss formulations for different tasks.
